So it has been about a month since I moved to trying Windows as my daily driver. I have to say, it hasn't been all bad, but I have noticed what I do with my computer had changed a lot based on what machine I was on. Starting out, I noticed myself gaming a lot more when I got off of work and got home. I would log-in and spend hours on Once Human in their new scenario based around dreams and reality mixing.

### Gaming Influences

So, one of the first biggest influences I learned about is that I feel a drive to game more when on Windows. This being my biggest guilty pleasure as said earlier, Once Human. Then I enjoy jumping into VR a little more frequently as well, as it just so much easier to jump into it from my desktop on Windows. You can see below my guilty pleasure some of the images from my base.

### Development Struggles

As someone who typically develops on Linux or MacOS... was a bit odd trying to leverage my development tooling on a Window base. It caused me lots of issues and oddities, which created frustrations for me. Getting Node to install with NVM on Windows was a very large pain. As I continued to fuss with this for about a week, I then remembered Windows Sub-System for Linux, and this did solve a lot of my issues but still introduced some odd behavior.

The Windows Sub-System for Linux did introduce some other issues for me, around getting files in and out since it is mounted as a separate drive. This made just getting things checked into Git using my desktop clients a bit more complicated. However, it was surprising how well it worked though to just run my apps locally and access with my windows browser even though the app was running in the sub-system.

### Will I Stick With It?

Mostly, it hasn't been too bad since I was running with most the annoying stuff disabled through scripts I talked about in my post from earlier last month. However, I am a bit annoyed still with many of the complicated tooling for development needing to use the sub-system for the best development experience. Also with the increased temptations to game, just is not good for my ability to focus on getting personal projects done.

So I think I will return to Linux as my daily driver again and keep this PC for gaming and VR usage. It will allow me to focus on the coding projects and wants to learn new languages and continue to develop my development skills. I hope that my journey was somewhat insightful for those reading.
