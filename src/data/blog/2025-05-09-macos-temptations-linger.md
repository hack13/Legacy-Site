So, being on Linux again, and writing my blog post recently about how I've been enjoying the platform.... I have realized it is slowly eating away at me a little by little for certain things, mainly around creative products for video editing. This prevents me from selling my M1 MacBook Air and M4 Pro Mac Mini. I mean, I barely use them, and continue to force myself as much as I can to not use them.

### Video Editing Software

I will start off by saying, I downloaded Kdenlive and it seems capable... but I have to say I have grown used to the ease of Wondershare Filmora, of which I have a lifetime license from before they discontinued that, which entitles me on MacOS to get free upgrades for life. I have been enjoying the ease of use and its tools for editing videos. I know this means I should probably put more effort into learning how to leverage the other options for Linux. With that said, I may look into having my M4 Mac Mini placed into my Server Rack downstairs and find a good remote desktop control for doing video editing on that system over my LAN and running a few other things, just to keep using those apps I have licenses for and I know well.

My other big reason for not wanting to try and learn another video editing platform on open source ones is that they can be powerful... but I am not a big person wishing to be that into video editing. I enjoy doing it as a small side hobby, and many of these programs like Filmora make that work for me a lot easier, and it doesn't need a lot of knowledge, as the tooling is very simple and easy to use. I am unaware of tools like that on Linux, as they tend to be creative software, but from my experience, they are still locked to Windows and Mac.

### Development Tools

The other thing that sits in my head is to consider just returning to MacOS for a daily driver, as the amount of nice tooling for just returning to MacOS as a daily driver is a consideration. I love apps like TablePlus (their Linux version has been getting much better, thankfully. But I do miss apps like Fork, but... it doesn't run well under Wine, and I end up paying for GitKraken, which continues to go up in cost each year... where Fork was a one-time purchase. Then, the same editors I use work on all platforms, so I shouldn't be too upset about that front.

That said, it is nice to be on an x86 system, knowing the containers and such I build and test will match what will run on my servers. I also know all the editors and tooling I use; it runs cross-platform, which makes that part a non-issue. It just sucks that some of the nicer well rounded tools I am used to just are not here on Linux desktop yet.

### Battery Life

So, one thing that bothers me is that the battery life of my Framework 13 is nowhere near as long as it is on my M1 MacBook Air. It is so nice and great to know that if I close the lid and open it back up at a shop or elsewhere, it still has multiple hours of battery life. I have tried to tweak my sleep and hibernate settings on my Framework laptop, but it still doesn't come anywhere near the same amount of time I can use on battery power alone.

With the talk of the long battery life, it is also kind of silly for me to even bring that up, considering that I hardly even use it!!! I am almost always next to an outlet and my batter lasts about 4-5 hours of intense use when I am out which if I am in a cafe for that long without plugging in... I should maybe go home or just bring a freaking charger.

### Conclusion

While there are all these small things, pressuring me to consider returning to MacOS... I am still trying my best to stick to my guns on this. I am growing more in love with how I am happy with this 3-year-old board in my Framework laptop (it is a new laptop, but I just chose not to get the new Ryzen AI boards), and I know that Linux doesn't need me to have anything powerful. The other part is understanding, I can actually upgrade this laptop's parts ... it just takes a few screws that are captive and boom I am inside and can replace any particular part easily.

I also enjoy returning to Linux after taking a few years' break to use MacOS and realizing how much smoother things have gotten and that a lot of software has started getting ported over. Now, if you are a creative professional... I could argue that I'm still better off on MacOS or Windows, just because that suite of tools on those platforms is still the industry-leading standard. However, Linux is great for developers like me! I have pretty much everything I need, and I don't feel pressured to update my hardware because Linux isn't pressuring me to think that "ooo I gotta have it, though I don't need it" feeling I get with Mac because I just wanna squeeze that extra new GPU cores etc... but realizing that I have a gaming rig running windows and my Framework 13 attached to a Thunderbolt dock for everything else.

I am happy, and I will continue to push forward and reclaim my wallet and mind from wanting to spend so much on things like software and hardware I don't need.
