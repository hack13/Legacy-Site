So I am someone who doesn't really get into games that much, but I recently got invited to an "early access" game that has gotten mixed reactions from the public. I will admit, I did in the beginning agree that "wow, this game just seems like it has a lot of asset flipping and lots of re-used assets... but eh the stuff seems alright so far..." but after a bit of playing I found myself glued to collection of resources and building out my base, and even interacting with others.

Now, before I dig in too much deeper... I think it is important to point out that I am not someone who is a big gamer... and don't play that many games, so when I talk about some of these features it might be something you see in many other games now... and I am just oblivious because I don't play games that much.

## Wishes/User Messages

So one thing that is very new to me is seeing messages that other players in the open world are able to just drop all over the world in things called "wishes" which seem really cool to me. Lots of users tend to write messages that are just comments of how nice the scenery is or tips on where stuff is hidden on the map when at a mission location. However, my favorite is there is just lots of messages of just raw encouragement of like "You got this, you are important and keep pushing forward every day." Stuff like that, isn't something I would think to see of people in video games, especially from other players.

## Base Building

One of the other big things I have been enjoying about this game is the ability to build your own base. It is really cool in the since that your base exists in the open world along side other players, and you use them to craft and store resources. However, you also use them to stand up vending machines to sell stuff you have crafted or gathered to other players. It is also one of the cool ways to use the real world money if you choose to buy into the game, to get special cosmetics items for your home. Even if you don't invest real money, you can pick up tons of customization items by exploring the world and looting... typically looting in the optional areas of the map tend to show up more of the stuff for your base.

## Deviations

Inside your base you also collect and use these creatures called "Deviations" which can be use for crafting, resource gathering, combat, and other bonus effects. They end up helping you keep your base functioning while you are away and/or offline... but they are also can just be really cute running around your home. I love the living dragon fursuit like creature who helps you cook your food, and gives their buffs an increased percentage.

## Amazing World

Lastly I just have to say, the world is so pretty... it is somewhat horror themed as it is post-disaster... but as you see that is one of the cities you end up going to that just has such a good photogenic look. I will say that sometimes the buildings can seem a bit repetitive, but they do try to mix it up a bit... but it is still something I enjoy just going around and enjoying all the scenic views in the game.

I am currently playing on the "Way Of Winter" now, as my second season... and I have to say I have very much been enjoying the additon of having to worry about warmth and heat. It also lets us build those really cool towers for people to build their bases around to help fight the weather of where you are.
