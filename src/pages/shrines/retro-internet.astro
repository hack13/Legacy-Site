      The retro Internet is the Internet I grew up on. It is the Internet that I
      personally miss the most. Every year, I see more and more of the internet
      consolidate into a few big companies. I see everyone moving from Forums to
      using just Reddit, Discord, or other social media platforms. Then people's
      so called sites are just a collection of links to their social media
      accounts, instead of a place where they host their own content themselves.

      I was a little after the Geocities era, but I still remember the days of
      Freewebs, Anglefire, and other free web hosting site. People woudl still
      put stuff on their own site, images, blogs, and one friend even videos
      with the old early YouTube. They would record videos with Bandicam
      software of them playing Halo CE, and all the custom maps they would play.
      It was a pretty cool website, and they had built it with Freewebs.
