      This game is where my name comes from. I have been a fan of the of the
      .hack// franchise since I was 13 years old. This is sadly but true, how I
      came up with my name "hack13". I have a lot of fond memories of playing
      the games, watching the anime, and reading the managa and novels. I have a
      lot of nostalgia for the series and it has a special place in my heart.

          One of the biggest sites when I was younger, that is sorta still
          around but just as a forum. It is DotHackersNetwork, which can be
          found at
          <a
            href="https://www.dothackers.net"

          </a>. It was a place where I could find all sorts of content, and
          wallpapers for the .hack// series. I have a lot of fond memories of
          the site and the community that was there. I have a lot of nostalgia
          for the site.

          As you can see from the image, it was a very different time in web
          design. The site was very artistic and the donate button in order to
          afford the hosting costs. I remember seeing the site and thinking how
          cool it was to have a site dedicated to .hack//. It was my place where
          I kept up with the latest news and content for the series. It was a
          great place to find lore, leaks of the G.U. series that was coming
          out, and even fan art. I remember checking this site pretty much every
          day when I got online.
